# Josh's Pomodoro

## The Pomodoro Technique &reg;

[The Pomodoro Technique &reg;](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) was developed by Francesco Cirillo to facilitate productive, focused work. It is deliciously simple. Set a timer for 25 minutes &mdash; a "Pomodoro" &mdash; and focus on one task until the timer is done. Then take a short break. After four Pomodoros take a longer break. Repeat.

## This App

This is my own take on a Pomodoro web app. For fun, I added animations to visualize time remaining in the current interval. The timer's background turns from red to a light coral as the red circular segment's area shrinks relative to the elapsed time (implemented via the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). The favicon is replaced once every 10% of time elapsed with a similar graphic. Future improvements being considered include a history log and integrated todos.</p>

I must provide kudos to the [TomatoTimer](https://tomato-timer.com/) which I used until developing my own app.

Technologies used include HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4, JavaScript & jQuery.
